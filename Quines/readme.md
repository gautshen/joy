### Programs which output their own code.

Quines are a fascinating class of self-referential computer programs
that output their own source code. [The Wikipedia page on Quines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing))
provides a very good introduction to this topic.

This is a collection of Quine programs written by me.
